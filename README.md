# movie_sentiment

This project utilizes TF-IDF vectorization to classify movie review sentiment. The data set considered is the Cornell University Movie Review polarity dataset v2.0 obtained from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/.
The analysis utilizes Scikit-learn's pipelining functionality as well as user-defined functions to efficiently examine a naive bayes and random forest classifier.
